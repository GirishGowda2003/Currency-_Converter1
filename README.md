In finance, an exchange rate is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another currency.[1] Currencies are most commonly national currencies, but may be sub-national as in the case of Hong Kong or supra-national as in the case of the euro.[2]

The exchange rate is also regarded as the value of one country's currency in relation to another currency.[3] For example, an interbank exchange rate of 141 Japanese yen to the United States dollar means that ¥141 will be exchanged for US$1 or that US$1 will be exchanged for ¥141. In this case it is said that the price of a dollar in relation to yen is ¥141, or equivalently that the price of a yen in relation to dollars is $1/141.

The exchange rate may be quoted as a ratio, for instance, USD/EUR might be equal to 0.8625.[4] In this case, the ratio must be interpreted as adimensional, that is, USD/EUR=0.8625, or 1 USD = 0.8625 EUR, meaning that 1 United States dollar will be exchanged for 0.8625 Euros, or that 1 Euro will be exchanged for 1/0.8625=1.1594 United States dollars. Equivalently, EUR/USD = 1.1594.

Each country determines the exchange rate regime that will apply to its currency. For example, a currency may be floating, pegged (fixed), or a hybrid.[5] Governments can impose certain limits and controls on exchange rates. Countries can also have a strong or weak currency.[5] There is no agreement in the economic literature on the optimal national exchange rate policy (unlike on the subject of trade where free trade is considered optimal).[6] Rather, national exchange rate regimes reflect political considerations.[6]
